> [!NOTE]
> From now on, this will be the main script. It contains both [SAMURAI's Scenarios](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Scenarios) and [SAMURAI's Animations](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Animations) so the standalone scripts will not be updated any further. All new updates will be in this repo.

## Known Issues:

- Some particle effects are not visible to other players. I will probably fix them later but I'm quickly losing passion.

## Credits:

- [ShinyWasabi](https://github.com/ShinyWasabi) 
   - Taught me how to write a proper [search function](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3979688-post5.html) that disables game input while typing. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

- [Lonelybud](https://github.com/lonelybud) 
   - Taught me how not to crash the game everytime I pressed a button üò≠ I had no idea what the [fiber pool](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Scenarios/issues/1) was...

- [Deadlineem](https://github.com/deadlineem)
   - Gave useful feedback on scenarios and also was there whenever I asked for insight in UC forum.

- [Harmless](https://github.com/Harmless05) 
   - Wrote a very neat config system for [Harmless's Scripts](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/Harmless-Scripts). So neat in fact that I stole it! üò∏
