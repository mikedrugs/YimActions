> [!NOTE]
> From now on, this will be the main script. It contains both [SAMURAI's Scenarios](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Scenarios) and [SAMURAI's Animations](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Animations) so the standalone scripts will not be updated any further. All new updates will be in this repo.

## Known Issues :

- Trying to search for an animation that doesn't exist will throw a nil value error. This only happens with Animations not Scenarios because the animation script has a function that constantly looks for the anim index and if there isn't one, it will _**PANIK**_. 
> If you don't know what any of that means, ignore it. It's not really an issue but an "_acoustic_" coding on my part.
