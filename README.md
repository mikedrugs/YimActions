> [!NOTE]
> From now on, this will be the main script. It contains both [SAMURAI's Scenarios](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Scenarios) and [SAMURAI's Animations](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Animations) so the standalone scripts will not be updated any further. All new updates will be in this repo.

## Known Issues:

- Some particle effects are not visible to other players. I will probably fix them later but I'm quickly losing passion.

Taught me how not to crash the game everytime I pressed a button üò≠ I had no idea what the fiber pool was...
